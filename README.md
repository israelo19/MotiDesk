At the moment when a user is a certain distance away it displays the words "Come Back Soon!", but when the user comes close, it displays, "Success is only achieved through hard work!" on the serial Monitor. 

### Date: Dec 20, 2023
I've built a very basic prototype, when the user is a distance away the LCD displays, "Come back later!" as it moves left accross the screen, and when a user is detected, it displays, "Sky is the limit!" while playing a 1KHz sound signal from a passive buzzer as it moves left across the screen. The buzzer signifies the end goal music that will be playing.
