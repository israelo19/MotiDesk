# Motivational-Sensor
I am in the process of creating a device that would display motivational messages to a user once they return back to their desk.

This project uses an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic senor that would detect whether or not a user is present. My intention for this project is that it will display the message across an LCD Screen with LED lights around the screen. 

At the moment when a user is a certain distance away it displays the words "Come Back Soon!", but when the user comes close, it displays, "Success is only achieved through hard work!" on the serial Monitor.
